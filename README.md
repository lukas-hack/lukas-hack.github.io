### Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/" target="_blank">University of Mannheim</a> and a member of the Bonn-Mannheim <a href="https://www.crctr224.de/" target="_blank">Collaborative Research Center Transregio 224</a>, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). My main research fields are macroeconomics, monetary economics and public economics.

  (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/istrefiklodiana/" target="_blank">Klodiana Istrefi</a> and <a href="https://matthias-meier-econ.github.io/" target="_blank">Matthias Meier</a>, December 2023)</summary>
  
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | We propose a novel identification design to estimate the causal effects of systematic monetary policy on the propagation of macroeconomic shocks. The design combines (i)~a time-varying measure of systematic monetary policy based on the historical composition of hawks and doves in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with (ii) an instrument that leverages the mechanical FOMC rotation of voting rights. We apply our design to study the effects of government spending shocks. We find fiscal multipliers between two and three when the FOMC is dovish and below zero when it is hawkish. Narrative evidence from historical FOMC records corroborates our findings. |

  <summary markdown="span"><font color="blue">Progressive Income Taxation and Inflation: The Macroeconomic Effects of Bracket Creep</font>
    
  (draft coming soon)</summary>
  
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | Under progressive taxation, inflation drives up tax rates if the schedule is not adjusted accordingly, leading to bracket creep effects. I propose a non-parametric decomposition of changes in tax rates to measure the empirical importance of bracket creep. Studying German administrative tax records, I show that bracket creep effects are of similar importance as discretionary tax changes. Bracket creep has decreased over time due to institutional changes, but the 2022 inflation surge led to a resurgence with sizeable bracket creep effects. Theoretically, I characterize the effects on labor supply and compute a theory-consistent measure of bracket creep -- the indexation gap -- that is used to discipline a New Keynesian model with incomplete markets. The model is used to study the propagation of inflationary shocks that partly propagate through bracket creep. |

  <summary markdown="span"><font color="blue">The Systematic Origins of Monetary Policy Shocks</font>
    
  (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/istrefiklodiana/" target="_blank">Klodiana Istrefi</a> and <a href="https://matthias-meier-econ.github.io/" target="_blank">Matthias Meier</a>, draft coming soon)</summary>
  
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | We show that conventional identification strategies for monetary policy shocks yield contaminated shocks if systematic monetary policy varies over time. The contamination renders the (mis)identified shocks predictable by time variation in systematic monetary policy interacted with the macroeconomic variables to which monetary policy responds. Using a measure of US systematic monetary policy based on the historical composition of hawks and doves in the FOMC, we empirically confirm the prediction. We then propose a new series of monetary policy shocks that accounts for time variation in systematic monetary policy. Our new shocks have substantially stronger effects on inflation and output. |
