  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | We propose a novel identification design to estimate the causal effects of systematic monetary policy on the propagation of macroeconomic shocks. The design combines (i)~a time-varying measure of systematic monetary policy based on the historical composition of hawks and doves in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with (ii) an instrument that leverages the mechanical FOMC rotation of voting rights. We apply our design to study the effects of government spending shocks. We find fiscal multipliers between two and three when the FOMC is dovish and below zero when it is hawkish. Narrative evidence from historical FOMC records corroborates our findings. |

  (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/istrefiklodiana/" target="_blank">Klodiana Istrefi</a> and <a href="https://matthias-meier-econ.github.io/" target="_blank">Matthias Meier</a>, February 2025)</summary>
  
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | Conventional strategies to identify monetary policy shocks rest on the implicit assumption that systematic monetary policy is time-invariant. In an environment with time-varying systematic monetary policy, we formally show that these strategies yield shocks that are contaminated, leading to bias in estimated impulse responses. In line with our theoretical results, we empirically show that conventional monetary policy shocks are predictable by measured fluctuations in systematic monetary policy. We propose new shocks that are purged of this predictability. Our preferred new shocks show that U.S.~monetary policy affects inflation and output more strongly and faster compared to the corresponding conventional shocks. |

  (with <a href="https://rostam-afschar.de/" target="_blank">Alessandro Franconi</a>, December 2025)</summary>
  
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  |  We estimate the macroeconomic effects of U.S. import tariff shocks, using several tariff measurement and identification approaches. Tariff shocks reduce output but increase consumer prices. Monetary policy partially accommodates these shocks with a policy easing. To quantify the dependence on systematic monetary policy, we use empirically identified monetary policy shocks to construct counterfactuals that are robust against model misspecification and the Lucas critique. When monetary policy strictly stabilizes inflation, the output contraction at the trough is 36\% larger than in the baseline. In contrast, strict output stabilization implies a peak inflation effect that almost doubles, compared to the baseline.|

  (with <a href="https://rostam-afschar.de/" target="_blank">Davud Rostam-Afschar</a>, May 2025)</summary>
  
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  |  We examine how macroeconomic news affects firms’ extensive-margin price-setting plans in a survey that we rolled out with randomized daily invitations. These plans predict future realized inflation. Using a high-frequency event study framework, we find that inflation and employment surprises imply significant and sizable revisions in firms' pricing plans. There is a limited role for news about the trade balance, but no significant role for other commonly studied data releases, e.g., industrial production. We also study news coverage and agents' news search behavior, finding that the intensive-margin response of media coverage and news search may partly drive our main results.|

  <summary markdown="span"><font color="blue">Understanding Firm Dynamics with Daily Data</font> [abstract]
    
  (with <a href="https://rostam-afschar.de/" target="_blank">Davud Rostam-Afschar</a>, January 2025)</summary>
  
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | How quickly do firms adjust their plans and expectations after macroeconomic shocks? To answer this, we run a daily survey of German firms featuring randomized daily invitations. Thus, we receive daily survey responses with a stable composition of firms. We use this to construct daily time series and estimate the responses to three macroeconomic shock series. Our overarching finding is that firms respond within days to oil supply and monetary policy shocks during the post-Covid inflation surge. We further document heterogeneity across firm types and show that expectations are an important channel through which monetary policy transmits to firms’ plans. |

  <summary markdown="span"><font color="blue">Progressive Income Taxation and Inflation: The Macroeconomic Effects of Bracket Creep</font> [abstract]

  (August 2025)</summary>

    
  </summary>
  
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | Under nominal progressive taxation, inflation drives up tax rates if the schedule is not adjusted, leading to bracket creep. To isolate bracket creep from other sources of tax rate changes, I propose a non-parametric decomposition approach. Applying the decomposition to German administrative tax records, I find sizeable bracket creep episodes. While the overall importance of bracket creep has decreased over time due to institutional changes, the post-Covid inflation surge led to a resurgence. Theoretically, I show how bracket creep affects labor supply decisions in a partial equilibrium framework and estimate a theory-consistent measure of bracket creep, the indexation gap, which is used to discipline a New Keynesian model with incomplete markets. The model predicts that bracket creep leads to a transitory steepening of the Phillips curve arising endogenously in response to a monetary shock. Such a steepening may alleviate the output costs of monetary disinflation. |

  (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lukas-diebold" target="_blank">Lukas Diebold</a>, May 2025)</summary>
  
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  |  This paper studies the funding structure of governments, examining financing beyond traditional sovereign bond markets. We document significant heterogeneity in the use of bonds and loans, and in the composition of foreign and domestic creditors. We relate this heterogeneity to sovereign credit ratings and present three key findings. First, sovereigns adjust the composition of financing instruments when credit ratings change. Second, not all rating changes and countries are alike. We find strong evidence for substitution from bonds to loans only when (i) credit ratings decrease for (ii) countries that have been rated sufficiently low. Third, the substitution toward loans is primarily financed through the domestic financial sector via foreign funds, and associated with a subsequent increase in financial distress, raising financial stability concerns. Finally, we show that the documented loan-bond substitution is also accompanied by a reduction in real GDP, primarily driven by a decline in investment, suggesting real adverse consequences.|
